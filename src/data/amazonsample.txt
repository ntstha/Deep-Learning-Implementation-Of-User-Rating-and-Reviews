title: Great for the hair, too!
review_time: 20130928
review: I wanted to try out this product for the "skin/hair care" side of it, though this product is "pure" enough that a little in my soup or skillet creates a nice  nutty aroma and mild taste - really good in this coconut curry soup I eat.That said, I brought the jar into my bathroom to keep it there instead of for cooking (I'll purchase another one for the kitchen). The one negative I have with this product for skin is that it's so thick and hard, I really have to dig in there to get a bit; however, once it's in the palm of my hand, the warmth of my skin melts it quite quickly. It can feel a little heavy and greasy at first, and the scent of coconut makes me think of cooking and not "beauty product;" but I mixed it with a little of my regular hand/body lotion and that was the ticket - it smoothed on my skin quite nicely and created a kind of "sheen" like those starlets have on their skin as they walk the red carpet with an insipid grin. Mixing it toned down the coconut scent, too.I did smooth it on my face, straight, and it did absorb quickly, and the scent of coconuts wasn't so strong after a few minutes. I have slightly sensitive skin with a little rosacea and the product didn't break me out or irritate my skin.But! The best "beauty" use I had from this product that SOLD me, is what it did to my hair! One morning I smoothed the coconut oil on my hair, paying particular attention to the ends. I threw my hair up in a ponytail and left the coconut oil in for at least an hour and a half. I rinsed it out with very warm water and then I shampooed twice. When I stepped out of the shower, I realized I was going to be late for an appointment. I quickly combed my hair, dressed, jumped into my car, and let the opened windows dry my hair, every so often shaking it out and combing through with my fingers -- I couldn't believe it! by time I reached my appt 35 minutes away, my hair was soft and smooth -  even with the wind hitting it - no blow-dryer - no brushing it out - when I returned from the appt - again the windows open blowing my hair all over creation, I brushed my hair and it was so soft and shiny and smooth. That sold me -- if I don't use this product for anything else, it's worth it for how it made my hair look and feel!UPDATE! - I bought another container of this to use in the kitchen - omg! If you saute shrimp in it, you not only have the aroma of coconut, but the shrimp taste incredible! I also fry or scramble eggs with it - mmmmmm - this stuff is amazing.

title: Just great, simple as that!,
review_time: 20140214
review: I ordered this to use as a moisturizer on my face as my skin is very sensitive. I was looking for a natural and inexpensive product and this sounded like a good thing to try. I have been very happy with it. I mix a small bit with some 100% Pure Sweet Almond Oil - 16 oz and put it on my face after showering.It feels wonderful and leaves my skin feeling smooth all day. I use to have very dry skin and would break out with the worst case of acne almost on a weekly occurrence. The almond and coconut oil have been amazing. There are ton of other uses for them as well.I use the coconut oil in the shower sometimes too. It has a wonderfully light coconut smell and leaves my hair conditioned and moisturized without any buildup. It rinses very easily and gives my hair that extra bounce. I will keep looking for more uses for these oils, I could go on forever how great they are but I won't! Instead I'll just say for what I've used them for so far, they've been just great!

title: Long-time Nutiva user is impressed
review_time: 20130923
review: I use a lot of extra virgin coconut oil, so much that I usually buy the Nutiva 2-pack of 54-ounce jars. I tried Vitacost's and didn't like it as much as Nutiva, so I've stuck with the Nutiva and really had not planned to switch brands. When I was offered the opportunity to review the Viva Labs product, I agreed but was doubtful I was going to be swayed.Well, let me tell you, when I opened up this coconut oil, I was amazed at the difference. This is an extra virgin coconut oil I could actually imagine myself taking by the tablespoonful, as was recommended by several health books my sister shared with me for people suffering from candida albicans infections. I've used my Nutiva for popping popcorn, cooking, and for skin care, but now I'm thinking I'll just use up the Nutiva for frying and go straight for the Viva Labs version for everything else. There's just no contest.A great use for this coconut oil is as a butter replacement on toast. My Nutiva spreads and melts like one of those margarines that take a long time to melt; the Viva Labs spreads like softened butter and melts like a dream.Price-wise, I've been spending about 47 cents an ounce for the Nutiva when I buy it in the big bulk pack. I was thinking that, at almost 62 cents an ounce for the 15-ounce container, the Viva Labs was more expensivealthough I'd have to say it's worth it. But when I went to cost out some of the other Nutiva products, they ran as much per ounce if not more than the Viva Labs product.I'm impressed enough that I'll be switching.

title: A Million & 1 Uses - I even found a naughty use for it!
review_time: 20140212
review: Viva Labs' Coconut Oil was offered to me free for review and I loved it!  It comes in a plastic jar and can be a liquid or a solid depending on the temperature of your home.  When I received it, it was a liquid, so I put a little in a squirt bottle (for the shower - see below), but the next day it was a solid because of the temperature inside my home - I just ran the bottle under some warm water and it quickly liquefied so I could squeeze it out.After receiving my Viva Labs' Coconut Oil, I ventured out onto the web to see what I could use it for and wow!  There are loads of different ways to use coconut oil:* Cooking* Baking* Skin Care* Hair Care* Aromatherapy* Kitty Cats (put it on their paws to reduce hairballs and promote a shiny coat)* Google it and I am certain you will find a million ways to use it!So, how did I use it?In the kitchen:  I was thinking that it would only be good in dishes that were sweet, but it doesn't have a sweet taste at all.  I actually fried an egg with it and I couldn't tell that I didn't use regular oil.  Coconut oil has a high smoke point, so frying an egg was totally fool-proof and I did notice that it didn't spatter all over the stove like vegetable oil does and my favorite thing about it was that my kitchen didn't smell like fried food for days - which is one of the main reasons I never fry anything!Shower: I always use baby oil (while my skin is wet) as a moisturizer, so instead of my baby oil, I switched it up and started using the coconut oil.  A little bit goes a long way, but it soaks into the skin quite nicely and left me feeling silky smooth with no greasy feeling and it smells delicious!Makeup Remover:  I also use baby oil to remove my waterproof mascara, so I used the coconut oil and it worked like a charm!Exfoliator:  I also used it as an exfoliator on my hands, feet and body - mix it with a little sugar while you are in the shower.  It is an inexpensive way to get rid of that dry and flaky skin and again...  leaves you with silky smooth skin.I saw that you could use it as a deep conditioning treatment on your hair - it works there too - I smoothed A LITTLE on my hair and left it overnight and then washed it out in the morning.  My hair was nice and shiny and didn't look greasy at all.  My hair is super short, but I could imagine that a person who might really notice a difference would be someone with long hair who battles with their hair being dry and or frizzy would really notice a difference.Finally, you can use it as a sexual lubricant - yes, well, you know!  It wouldn't be a "Bookie Nookie" review if I didn't bring something naughty into it!  There is ZERO sugar in coconut oil - which is a common concern when using "food" products that are sweet in or around those girly parts (sugar in THAT area can cause a yeast infection o_O).  There were no issues with that and definitely reduced the friction and helped things glide quite nicely :-DViva Labs' Coconut Oil is definitely a product I would use again and I would and have recommended it to my friends.  At around 11 bucks for a 16-ounce jar, it's affordable and has a million uses - you have nothing to lose by checking it out. Product provided by Viva Labs for an honest review.

review: I was asked to review this Coconut Oil and as a regular user who keeps a jar at the bedside I can happily give it five stars. I use it for beauty and moisturization more than cooking so my review will focus on that.This oil is light, non sticky, and moisturizes beautifully. The scent is natural coconut. Pleasant and not overwhelming.

review: This is amazing, especially from this company in particular. So far it's healed my dry/cracked hands in two days, my daughters diaper rash over night (and I've completely replaced all her body lotions with it-she's so much softer and happier), my face is completely blemish/acne free after using it for 4 days, and it soothed and worked as a great antibacterial ointment for my husbands cuts and scrapes from work. Just a little dab goes a super long way and this container will last me for a good month - even when using it every day! I am so satisfied that Viva Labs now has a new customer for life!

title: A healthy oil with a multitude of uses
review_time: 20130922
review: In the last few months, I've reviewed two books that touted the value of coconut oil and its many uses. When I searched for "coconut oil" in Amazon books, I got several thousand hits. It's definitely a hot topic these days, yet I can remember when the consumption of coconut oil was widely disparaged because of its saturated fat. Fast forward a few decades, and although some health authorities still don't like coconut oil, the tide has turned and the oil is being praised for its many benefits, both internal and external.The Viva Labs product is "extra virgin." Since it hasn't been refined or heavily processed, it has a very mild coconut taste and aroma, both of which were very pleasant to my palate and nose. The melting temperature is about 76 F, so at most room temperatures, the oil has a soft creamy texture. I tried a spoonful, and it's quite tasty. I then fried some breaded shrimp in the oil, and it was delicious. I'm looking forward to substituting coconut oil for olive or canola oil in some of the recipes my wife and I use.Healthwise, because much of the saturated fat of extra virgin coconut oil is in the form of lauric acid, coconut oil is considered to be a better alternative to partially hydrogenated vegetable oils when solid fats are required. In addition, virgin coconut oil is composed mainly of medium-chain triglycerides (aka "healthy fats"), which may not carry the same risks as other saturated fats. Recent findings indicate that daily consumption of coconut oil may boost brain performance and could even help to prevent Alzheimer's.The two books on coconut oil that I reviewed also mentioned the external uses of the product for improving skin moisture and appearance, and for aromatherapy and massage therapy. It can even be used as a restorative treatment on hair.Coconut oil is definitely a hot product today, and my experience with the Viva Labs Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil has been very positive.

I liked oil pulling, but I hate wasting the oil that way. It is very high quality, tasty stuff! They say you should consume up to 3 teaspoons of it a day. Very excellent quality stuff here :)

review: I have just discovered coconut oil and I definitely love it! I have used it as pre-shampoo mask (it takes time and it's a little bit messy to have oil in your hair, but it's worth it) and as make-up remover. It works perfectly, even with waterproof mascara. It's great not having to use aggressive and chemicals-loaded products to remove make-up. I am also using it on my feet, which are super dry. Overall, great product, (and fantastic smell).

title: I'm Changing Brands to Viva Labs Coconut Oil!
review_time: 20130924
review: I received a free sample of coconut oil from Viva Labs in exchange for my honest review, and I'm pleased to say I'm highly impressed. In comparison to the brand of coconut oil I typically buy, the Viva Labs brand has a faint but noticeable aroma of coconut.The consistency is creamy and when rubbed onto the skin, it dissolves instantly and absorbs without leaving a greasy residue. I rubbed some on a laceration on my leg and the coconut oil relieved the itching and left the skin noticeable softer and smoother.I used it in baking and frying with excellent results. My family gobbled up the biscuits and fried potatoes, and the only comment they made was that the fried potatoes had just a hint of coconut flavor. However, everyone agreed it was an intriguing flavor twist.Our favorite experiment with using the oil was to pop some organic popcorn. We all agreed the coconut oil added a little extra flavor to the corn, and I ended up popping two batches because everyone wanted more.I am not going to discuss price point comparisons because to me other considerations are more important than price. For my family, I'm willing to pay a few cents more to get an organic product that is packaged in a BPA free container and certified by the NON GMO Project as a pure food. It's also important to me for the oils I use to be extra-virgin, cold pressed and unrefined so Viva Labs Coconut Oil is the perfect match for my household needs.I'd recommend this product to anyone who is concerned about the increasing proliferation of genetically modified organisms being introduced into our food supply and looking for a healthier option.Viva Labs #1 Organic Extra Virgin Coconut OilDisclosure of Material Connection: I received this Coconut Oil free  book free from Viva Labs in exchange for a product review. I was not required to  write a positive review. The opinions I have expressed are my own. I am disclosing this in accordance with the Federal Trade Commission's 16 CFR, Part 255: "Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising."

review: Great quality coconut oil. I don't use it for cooking but I use it for just about everything else. I put a tablespoon in my coffee to help burn belly fat (this really works when used in conjunction with exercise and a healthy diet of course). I use it as a toothpaste, a moisturizer, diaper rash cream. It's fabulous.This brand in particular has nice mild coconutty flavor and I love that the jar has a wide mouth and is easy to scoop out the oil. The jar is plastic however which is my only issue with it but I will continue to order it.

title: This is the best coconut oil I've never tired before!
review_time: 20140128
review: I ordered this coconut oil because I saw this product have almost 5 star with 700 above reviewer to wrote the review, so I curious about this product, and suspect is it that good?! After I received the product, I opened it, and have coconut smell that not too strong,like a nature coconut smell that would not make you feel sick. I also like the texture too, it is not too light, but not too thickness,  the texture is a little bit thicker than all of coconut oil I bought before. I must admitted that this coconut oil is more moisturise that other coconut oil I bought. I usually use this oil and organic extra virgin olive oil mix together, to put on the body before going to shower. I like taking shower with hot hot water, so if I put oil before shower, it can protect my skin, and not too dry that prevent to cause pityriasis. It is really important!!! People who have pityriasis, might thought that is because gene or inheritance,I think it is not true! My mother,father, and sister did not have that problem but me(So sad>.<)! I had pityriasis one time before, I realized that was because the body lack of oil and moisturise, and actually that is the signal, the body is telling you," I feel sick, please give me water and oil". So just like we are human being need oxygen and water!.Using oil before shower actually not just prevent have skin problem, but also a tips for you guys that it can treat as massage, and relax the body. Most importantly, after shower, you wont feel dry!

review_time: 20130928
review: This is non-GMO and organic.  I look for both of those in coconut oil (in most of our food actually). But this is also a very high quality product at a great price.  It is so white and smells very fresh.  I use coconut oil in a lot of my cooking and ALWAYS when popping corn...if you haven't used coconut oil to pop corn, try it.  Movie theaters have always used it, but I am pretty sure they don't use high quality oil like this.  It makes the BEST popcorn plus ads very healthy short chain fatty acids to your diet.  I also use it on my skin and on my hair occasionally.  We use a LOT of coconut oil in this house.I've tried many brands, including Nutiva and the bucket of organic that Costco sells.  This is at least as good as the best we've used and will definitely be using this product again.  As I said  the price is great for a product of this quality.

review: I've tried other brands of coconut oil that I like better (e.g., Living Foods), as Viva tends to dry out too quickly. This brand works well enough, especially when you compare it to other types of moisturizers.My usage: I regularly use unrefined coconut oil as a skin and hair moisturizer. In the winter, I like to spread a thin layer over my face, followed by a few min under a steamy washcloth. If I rinse out the washcloth and use it to wipe off the oil, it doesn't clog my pores and I feel moisturized all day.

review: This is the best moisturizing oil I have ever tried and now stick with it. I can guarantee 100% it really makes your skin super moist and unlike other products or lotion where you need to reapply cause it dries. This is the best so far and when I use it my skin stays soft and moist for 2 days. This works great on cracked feet or dry elbows or knees. After trying this oil I threw away all of my moisturizing lotions away they just can't compare with coconut oil. Yes and I suggest you do the same :) I recommend this for everyone. Love the coconut scent. Coconut oil and me are friends forever! Organic products are the best!

title: Versatile and Effective Product
review_time: 20140317
review: The product seems to do a great job at softening my natural hair (my hair doesn't have a consistent curl pattern, but I think it's somewhere in the 3c-4a range? who knows...). And it could just be me, but coconut oil also seems to make my usually fragile strands more elastic and thus less prone to breakage (if that makes any sense).For me, coconut oil works best when worked into natural hair that has been slightly "dampened" with water or a water-based product (like conditioner), and then bunned or banded for several hours (like overnight). When I let my hair down, it's as soft as a baby's...skin. I apply the product either as a solid (body heat melts it), or as a liquid (melted in the microwave). btw, I also use the coconut oil for pre-poos, hot oil treatments, scalp massages, or simply sealing moisture in my hair.Needless to say, I really like the product. It's versatility and the effectiveness that it seems to have on my natural was enough to make me want to buy it again. Just to give an estimate, a 16 oz container lasts me about a 1 1/2 months when I use a LOT (I have short-medium hair).The only con, if it is a con, is that this product will stiffen and return to its solid form when exposed to the cold (I don't know the exact temperature). But I thought it was hilarious when my hair stiffened in place during one frigid day in western NY. But don't worry, my hair quickly returned to its soft state as soon as I walked indoors. haha.

title: Love it!

review: I ordered this for me to jump on the oil-pulling bandwagon and give it a go, quite expecting to gag on it and shove it at the back of a cupboard to never see the light of day again.However its proving to be extremely versatile and a great product. The oil-pulling isnt as gross as I was expecting, just the first couple of minutes whilst it dissolves is the hardest. It is early days yet but my mouth and teeth do feel cleaner so I will keep on with it until my next dental check-up and see what my dentist thinks.What I am loving the most about this product is what it is doing for my skin and hair. As a hair masque it is better than anything else Ive used in the past. My hair is shiny, bouncy and very soft. It also makes a great serum for fly-aways and shine. I also like the way it feels on my elbows, knees, hands and lips and it looks like it is clearing up a spot of psoriasis I have on my leg.I will be buying more when this tub is empty and have recommended it to my friends.

review: I'm happy with this purchase. The coconut oil is very light, and not very dense and greasy as other brands. Also the smell is very subtle. My problem with other coconut oils were the smell was too strong.So yea this is good for both cooking or personal use on the body.

title: It doesn't have a strong flavor

review: I bought this to try oil pulling and it works fine for that. I don't like coconut flavoring very much so was pleasantly surprised to find that it has a very light taste of coconut.

title: Smooth Skin Finally!
review_time: 20140311
review: I have tried a bunch of different types of lotions to help with my dry hands and legs.  Problem solved.  I have been using it twice a day for a couple of weeks now and can see great results.  Skin is smoother and doesn't have a dry appearance.  The best part it is not oily.  It goes on as oil but gets absorbed relatively soon and you are left with smooth, silky skin but not oily.

title: So far, so good
review_time: 20140213
review: Bought this to use a a body oil for my dry skin. So far, it's been lovely! Got my husband to try it too and we both saw immediate difference after a hot shower. Really helps keep skin moisturized. Last night, I got too lazy to apply the oil, and an hour after my shower, I was itchy from dryness. Makes a difference! The only cumbersome part is having to melt down the oil to liquid with a lighter. But, for good skin - don't be lazy :p

review: I bought Viva Labs Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil because I had read a article that Kristie Alley liked this for makeup remover and in another article Jillian Michaels loves it for her skin.  And they were right.  IT IS PERFECT.  I have dry skin and this stuff is amazing, forget using it in cooking, you need to be using this for your skin.

title: Delicious and hollistic
review_time: 20140125
review: I really love this tub, it's filled to the brim with great quality organic extra virgin coconut oil and it smells divine by the way. Fragrance wise it shouldn't be confused with fresh juicy coconut as this is slightly smoky,  the oil has a delicate toffee like caramel coco tone that only lingers for a bit and doesn't clash with perfume, if anything those lipids will give it extra staying power. When the weather cools this solidifies but I just scoop it out and honestly this rarely leaves my bathroom. My favorite way of using it is after a shower or a bath, a nice thin layer of this oil scooped out and smoothed between the hands all over, it makes for the most luxurious skin treatment that leaves me feeling very relaxed, it's great in the morning if I'm not in a rush, it might take few minutes to skin in but it's especially wonderful at night. After using it I ooze into my bed and sleep deliciously, it's very soothing and spa like, my muscles always feel warm and pampered and it makes for the softest skin, even pricier creams don't work this well, I guess it's the nature and not chemical processes doing all the hard work.This is definitely edible, I know that I tend to use it more as a beauty treatment but many people take coconut oil as a supplement as well , I have cooked curries with it; Thai and Indian types, very tasty but not to be over heated as it can separate. For some reason the Viva labs brand feels better on my skin and hair, I have used the Nature's Way brand and it was good but this feel superior when used on the skin, something about it if beyond soothing and leaves the skin extra smooth, I'm going through a very hard cold winter in NY now and I use this oil in the am and pm after showering, my skin feels beyond soft, a real saver in bad weather when lotions aren't enough. This oil also makes for the best hair treatment, rub some in for a few hours and then shampoo out for the glossiest locks.- Kasia S.

review: I bought this coconut oil and honestly did not know what I was buying.  My friend told me that I could use it for several things so since I shop at Amazon and had a gift certificate I looked and chose this one.I use this for my very dry skin and all I can say is after a week of using it I am hooked.  I won't try any other coconut oil because I like this one and I say why mess with something that isn't broke!!!  I will buy again!!!

review: Wow. I honestly have used more than half the jar in a little over a week. I use it on toast and in my coffee in the morning. And as a face wash, moisturizer and shaving cream in the shower. I have really sensitive skin and this has really helped especially during the cold, dry winter. I'll be buying another jar soon.

review: I love this coconut oil. Smells great and can be used for many things. I use it as moisturizer once a week after a hot bath and leaves my skin unbelievably smooth. I also use it on my hair by massaging it into my scalp/hair and leaving overnight. When I shower and do my hair the next day my hair feels and looks very smooth. This product can also be used on eyelashes to make them healthier and some even say it helps them grow.

review: Using mostly for my body to soften skin and treat my hair. It works wonderfully! I don't plan to use it for cooking but enjoy it for body care. Who doesn't want soft skin?My husband is also using it in his beard to control it and stimulate growth, he loves it.
